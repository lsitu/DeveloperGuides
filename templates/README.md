# Templates

The following templates should be used in the creation of new projects.

Prior to creating the new project repository in Github, the [Copyright Disclosure Form](http://invent.ucsd.edu/invent/researchers/reporting-new-innovation/copyright-disclosure-form/) must be filled out and signed by the entire development team, and then emailed to the UCSD Technology Transfer Office.

Once the copyright disclosure form has been turned into TTO, proceed with
creating the new public repository in the [UCSD Library Organization](https://github.com/ucsdlib/) using the following templates.

In the case of the UC Copyright Notice and License they should be used
as-is. Other templates, such as Code Climate and Rubocop, may be used as starting points for customization as
required for the project.

* [UC Copyright Notice](UC_Copyright_Notice.txt)
* [Code Climate Configuration](.codeclimate.yml)
* License - Choose MIT from Github license listing.
