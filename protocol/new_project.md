Create New Project
==================

A guide for creating a new github project repository

Project README.md
=================
Each project should have a `README.md` file. See [Project README's][readme]


Copy Github template files
=================
Copy the files in the `.github` folder in the DeveloperGuides repository to `.github` in your new project.

Update each file as needed for the new project.

Merge Options
=================
Navigate to `Settings` and scroll to `Merge button`

Ensure only `Allow rebase merging` is selected

Collaborators & teams
=================
Navigate to `Settings` in the repository and click `Collaborators & teams`

At the minimum, you should grant the `Developers` and `Operations` groups `Write` access.

Protected Branches
=================
Navigate to `Settings` in the repository and click `Branches`

Following the Git Flow model, you should select the following in the Branches configuration for the repository:

Default Branch: `develop`

Protected Branch - `develop`:
  * Project this branch
  * Require pull request reviews before merging
  * Require status checks to pass before merging
  * Require branches to be up to date before merging

Protected Branch - `master`:
  * Project this branch
